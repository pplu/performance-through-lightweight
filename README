This repo has a collection of Docker images that let you practice
the techniques exposed in the talk "Performance through lightweight".

Each directory has a Makefile with two targets:

```
make container
```

Which builds the image in the directory. 

```
make run
```

Which runs the built container

----

Misc notes:

Delete all docker images from a machine

```
docker rmi $(docker images | awk 'NR>1 { print $3 }')
```
